# Deprecated in favor of [RVGL Companion](https://github.com/Nico264/RVGL-Companion)

# rvgl_scripts
Random helper scripts for use with RVGL

# Disclaimer
All the scripts done here will work on Linux, and try to fix case-related problems, I don't have a Windows box to test them onâ€¦

# How to use
 1. Download the script to a location that makes sense (Eg. the RVGL dir)
 2. Run the script a first time so it asks for your RVGL install folder and registers itself as the rvgl:// scheme handler
 3. You're ready to go! [Test it here!](https://www.nicolas-guichard.ovh/rvgl/launch "Launch RVGL")

# State of the scripts
## Done
 - Download and install assets at a given URL (zip or 7z compressed)
 - Download current month tracks
 - Fast launch and connect via link

### Send me any idea via GitHub issues

# Requirements
To use scripts accessing the internet (installers):`sudo -H pip3 install beautifulscraper`
